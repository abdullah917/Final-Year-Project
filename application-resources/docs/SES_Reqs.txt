The M&C shall provide users with the ability to display dialog windows to any position on the screen.

The M&C shall provide users with the ability to save the current windows position when the application is closed.

The M&C shall provide users with the ability to restore the windows position when the application is started.

The M&C shall supply a MOC Operator role which shall allow monitoring, only.

The M&C shall supply a MOC Operator role which shall allow monitoring and control.

The M&C shall support LDAP for user authentication and authorization. 

The M&C HMI will be comply with  ECSS-E-ST-10-11c where possible. 

The M&C component MMI shall be compatible with the operations defined by the functional and technical requirements.

The M&C components shall be implemented in a way that they can be deployed on both PMOC and BMOC.

The M&C component shall provide users with the ability to verify its complete functionality without connection to other EDRS MOC components or other EDRS entities.

The M&C component provided and used shall cover all EDRS MOC components interfaces served by the M&C component. 

The M&C component simulator shall support static simulations. 

The M&C component simulators shall be simple but sufficient to demonstrate interface compatibility.

The M&C component simulators shall be used in an integrated way to support the MOC overall verification and validation. 

The M&C component simulation details and the concept shall be described in the Software validation plan.

The M&C component test environment shall be capable of verifying all updates/changes to the MOC before their deployment.

The M&C component provider shall submit verification procedures to the customer for approval.

The M&C component verification document shall provide a matrix that shall identify the verification method: test, analysis, review, inspection, demonstration
for either a single requirement or a group of requirements and the parameters which shall be tested, demonstrated, analysed.


M&C component design verification by review of analytical data shall consist of a review of all applicable valid documentation, typically design drawings, technical  notes
in view of proper reflection and implementation of requirements of applicable specifications.

The the M&C component, analytical techniques may be used in lieu of, or to supplement testing as appropriate to verify specification requirements which cannot be verified by other methods;
The selected techniques  may include system engineering analysis, static, qualitative analysis and computer simulation.

M&C component requirements of a general nature should be verified by demonstration.

Demonstration should consist of performing typical operational procedures demonstrating the fulfilment of the requirements.

The M&C shall supply test drivers for those requirements which could not verified by review, inspection, analysis, inspection or demonstration.
