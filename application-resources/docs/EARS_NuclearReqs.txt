If any combustible, toxic or otherwise hazardous gases and vapours are released into the plant rooms, the air conditioning system shall remove the gases and vapours.

If the plant exhaust air contains or may contain radioactive materials in gaseous, aerosol or particulate form in amounts significant in terms of environmental radiation exposure, the air filtration system shall filter the exhaust air sufficiently.

The exhaust air system shall be capable of restricting the flow of exhaust air in order to reduce releases in the event of an accident.

Where a room can be subject to restricted exhaust air, where it is deemed necessary, the rooms shall have room-specific equipment that filter and cool the air of the room.	

The design of the exhaust air system shall give due consideration to the risk of the filters catching fire and burning.

If a filter catches fire, then the air-conditioning system shall isolate the filter from the rest of the air-conditioning system.

The guide YVL E6 shall specify the requirements for the coatings of structures inside the containment building.

The design of air-conditioning and ventilation systems shall comply with requirements presented in the guide YVL E6.

Where an individual componentâ€™s coated surface area is deemed so small that any coating material released from the surface does not clog the air flow paths, the requirements of the guide YVL E.6 shall not apply.
